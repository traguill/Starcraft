STARCRAFT COMMANDOS
***********************

Description
--------------------------------------------

Starcraft Commandos is a university project that consists in making a tribute to the original Starcraft.
We were able to change some aspects of the game to make it different, so we ended making a mix of Starcraft and Commandos.

How to install
--------------------------------------------

- Open the "Game" folder

- Double click to the "Starcraft Commandos.exe"

How to play
--------------------------------------------

The objective of the game is to collect the 3 bombs and arrive to the extraction point. If the firebats detects one of your units the game is lost. You can only fight the marines, but if your units die the mission is failed.

There are 3 different modes:

- Normal: as long as one unit survive you can finish the mission.
- Hard: if ONE unit dies the mission is failed.
- Pro: you play only with the Ghost. Good luck!
