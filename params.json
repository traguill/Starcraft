This mod is centred around the terran unit ghost, we will create a new level and new abilities in order to make the definitive steatlh mission on Starcraft.\r\n\r\nIn Starcraft Commandos you will command a elite squad of terrans formed by marines, firebats, a medic and the ghost. Every unit is necessary in this mission, so you can't just go ahead without a plan. You have to investigate the terrain and find the best way to advance.\r\n\r\nWe will use a lot of new mechanics of other classics of strategy in PC, like Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines (1998). The enemy units will have a cone of vision and they will alert other enemies if they catch you. We will also incorporate new abilities for the units. \r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the page you are able to watch the trailer of the game and also a gameplay, we hope you enjoy them!\r\n\r\n###  The Team\r\n\r\nThis project is being made by group of university students of [CITM-UPC](http://www.citm.upc.edu/) (Terrassa, Barcelona, Spain).
