If the firebats detects one of your units the game is lost. You can only fight the marines, but if your units die the mission is failed.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 different modes:\r\n\r\n- Normal: as long as one unit survive you can finish the mission.\r\n- Hard: if ONE unit dies the mission is failed.\r\n- Pro: you play only with the Ghost. Good luck!\r\n\r\nDebug Features\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- Press KP_1 to return to the main menu (in game)\r\n- Press F1 to enable debug mode:\r\n\t- Colliders are shown as red\r\n\t- Vision ranges are shown\r\n\t- Pathfinding nodes are shown\r\n\t- M: to create a marine\r\n\t- F: to create a firebat\r\n\t- G: to create a ghost\r\n\t- O: to create a observer (unit removed from the final game)\r\n\t- D: to create a enemy firebat\r\n\t- N: to create a enemy marine\r\n\t- L: to create a medic\r\n\t- K: to kill all your units (and lose)\r\n\r\n- Press KP_5 to open the level editor (only in the menu scene)\r\n\t- To create units use the same keys mentioned before\r\n\t- Click to select one or multiple units\r\n\t- Draging with the mouse will drag all the selected units\r\n\t- Click outside the units to deselect them\r\n\t- Middle button of the mouse with a selected unit (only one) to orient it.\r\n\t- Right click with one selected unit to create a node to patrol.
